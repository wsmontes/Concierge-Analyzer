Concierge API Sync Implementation Summary
========================================

COMPLETED CHANGES TO concierge_parser.py:
✅ Enhanced process_curation_data() to support server_id field
✅ Updated GET /api/restaurants to include id, server_id, and curator_id
✅ Updated POST /api/restaurants/batch to support server_id
✅ Added GET /api/restaurants/<id> - fetch single restaurant by ID
✅ Added PUT /api/restaurants/<id> - update existing restaurant
✅ Added DELETE /api/restaurants/<id> - delete restaurant and concepts  
✅ Added GET /api/restaurants/server-ids - get sync mapping data
✅ Added POST /api/restaurants/sync - bulk create/update/delete operations

DATABASE SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS:
⚠️  The restaurants table needs a server_id column:
    
    ALTER TABLE restaurants ADD COLUMN server_id VARCHAR(255);
    CREATE INDEX idx_restaurants_server_id ON restaurants(server_id);

SERVER DEPLOYMENT:
⚠️  The updated concierge_parser.py needs to be deployed to PythonAnywhere
⚠️  The server needs to be restarted to load the new endpoints

VALIDATION REQUIRED:
1. Run check_schema.py on the server to add server_id column
2. Deploy updated concierge_parser.py to PythonAnywhere  
3. Restart the Flask application
4. Test endpoints using test_sync_endpoints.py

NEW API ENDPOINTS SUMMARY:
================================

EXISTING ENDPOINTS (Enhanced):
- POST /api/curation - now supports server_id field
- GET /api/restaurants - now includes id, server_id, curator info  
- POST /api/restaurants/batch - now supports server_id

NEW SYNC ENDPOINTS:
- GET /api/restaurants/<id> - fetch specific restaurant
- PUT /api/restaurants/<id> - update restaurant (supports server_id)
- DELETE /api/restaurants/<id> - delete restaurant and relationships
- GET /api/restaurants/server-ids?has_server_id=true/false - sync mapping
- POST /api/restaurants/sync - bulk operations with create/update/delete arrays

SYNC WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
=====================

1. Find unsynced local restaurants:
   GET /api/restaurants/server-ids?has_server_id=false

2. Bulk sync operations:
   POST /api/restaurants/sync
   {
     "create": [{"name": "New Restaurant", "server_id": "srv_123"}],
     "update": [{"id": 5, "server_id": "srv_456"}], 
     "delete": [7, 8, 9]
   }

3. Individual operations:
   PUT /api/restaurants/5 {"server_id": "srv_789"}
   DELETE /api/restaurants/10

SYNC CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
========================
- server_id tracks local vs server entity relationships
- NULL server_id = local-only (not yet synced)
- Non-NULL server_id = synced entity
- Use timestamps and server_id for conflict resolution
- Bulk sync endpoint provides atomic transactions

ERROR HANDLING:
==============
- All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- Sync endpoint provides detailed error arrays  
- Support for partial success scenarios
- Transaction rollback on bulk operation failures

This implementation resolves the "Fix deleting" issue and provides
comprehensive synchronization infrastructure for the Collector app.
