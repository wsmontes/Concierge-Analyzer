# 
# FINAL FIX - Connection Pool Exhaustion
# Updated database.py to work with PythonAnywhere connection limits
#

## Problem

**Error:** `{"error":"Failed getting connection; pool exhausted"}`

**Cause:** PythonAnywhere has strict connection limits and a 5-minute timeout on idle connections. Connection pooling was causing pool exhaustion.

## Solution

Updated `database.py` to:
1. **Disable connection pooling** - Use direct connections instead
2. **Reduce pool size** from 5 to 2 (if pooling is used)
3. **Add connection timeout** - 10 seconds
4. **Add pool recycle** - 280 seconds (before 5-minute timeout)

## Files Changed

- `mysql_api/database.py` - Updated connection handling

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Upload Updated File (Recommended)

1. Go to PythonAnywhere **Files** tab
2. Navigate to `/home/wsmontes/Concierge-Analyzer/mysql_api/`
3. Click on `database.py`
4. Replace the entire content with the updated version from your local `mysql_api/database.py`
5. Save

### Option 2: Manual Edit on PythonAnywhere

In the `database.py` file on PythonAnywhere, make these changes:

#### Change 1: Line ~33 (pool size)
```python
# OLD:
self.pool_size = 5

# NEW:
self.pool_size = 2  # Reduced from 5 to avoid pool exhaustion on PythonAnywhere
```

#### Change 2: Line ~49-52 (connection parameters)
```python
# ADD these two lines at the end of the get_connection_params() return dictionary:
'pool_recycle': 280,  # Recycle connections after 280 seconds (before 5-min timeout)
'connect_timeout': 10  # Connection timeout in seconds
```

#### Change 3: Line ~90-98 (get_connection method)
```python
# OLD:
def get_connection(self):
    """Get a connection from the pool"""
    if self._pool is None:
        self._initialize_pool()
        
    try:
        return mysql.connector.connect(pool_name=self.config.pool_name)
    except mysql.connector.Error as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to get database connection: {e}")
        raise

# NEW:
def get_connection(self):
    """Get a connection - using direct connections instead of pooling for PythonAnywhere"""
    try:
        # Direct connection without pooling to avoid pool exhaustion on PythonAnywhere
        connection_params = self.config.get_connection_params()
        # Remove pool-specific parameters
        connection_params.pop('pool_recycle', None)
        return mysql.connector.connect(**connection_params)
    except mysql.connector.Error as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to get database connection: {e}")
        raise
```

## After Deployment

1. **Reload web app:** Web tab → Click "Reload" button
2. **Wait 10 seconds**
3. **Test:** `curl https://wsmontes.pythonanywhere.com/api/health`

## Expected Result

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T...",
  "data": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "database": "connected"
    },
    "api": "operational"
  }
}
```

## Why This Works

**Direct connections** instead of pooling:
- Each request creates a new connection
- Connection is closed immediately after use
- No pool exhaustion
- Works within PythonAnywhere's connection limits

**Connection recycling** (if pooling is re-enabled later):
- Connections are recycled before PythonAnywhere's 5-minute timeout
- Prevents "MySQL server has gone away" errors

## Performance Note

Direct connections (without pooling) have slightly more overhead per request, but:
- ✅ Avoids pool exhaustion
- ✅ Works reliably on PythonAnywhere
- ✅ Connection overhead is minimal for low-traffic sites
- ✅ More stable than fighting with pool limits

## If Still Having Issues

Check the error log (Web tab → Error log) for specific errors.

Common remaining issues:
- Password still incorrect
- Database doesn't exist
- Network connectivity issues

## Summary

- ✅ Password issue: Fixed (environment variable set)
- ✅ MySQL connection: Working
- ✅ Pool exhaustion: Fixed (disabled pooling)
- ⏳ Final test: After uploading database.py

**Next step:** Upload the updated `database.py` file and reload the web app.
